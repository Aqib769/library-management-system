# 📚 Library Management System Using Python and SQLite

A simple GUI-based Library Management System developed using **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **SQLite** to manage book records efficiently.

---

## 🧾 Project Overview

The Library Management System is a desktop application designed to automate the process of managing library book records. It allows users to add new books, view existing records, and delete books using an intuitive graphical interface. All data is stored securely in an SQLite database, ensuring persistence and reliability.

This project replaces manual record-keeping with a digital solution, reducing errors and improving efficiency.
